# Habit Tracker

Inspired by James Clear's [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits), this app helps users stick to their habits by employing the [Seinfeld method](https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy).

Users can login with a Google account and create new habits. Each day users can mark habits as complete. Seeing a record of successful days motivates users to not break the chain.

This app is created with Angular 7, mdbootstrap, and hosted on Firebase.
